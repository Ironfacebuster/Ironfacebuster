## A Tasting of My Projects

1. Samsung Tizen Twitch app - **NOT PUBLIC**
2. WIP "social media" site.- **NOT PUBLIC**
3. [NodeCraft](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/NodeCraft) - b1.6.6 minecraft server, written in NodeJS
4. NodeBoy - a GameBoy "emulator" ALSO written in NodeJS, **NOT PUBLIC**.
5. [Cards Against Discord](https://top.gg/bot/561675421364781069) - A Cards Against Humanity bot. The FIRST of the name "Cards Against Discord". Unfortunately I have not released updates for this bot in quite some time.
6. [LottoBotto](https://top.gg/bot/425441496158830593) - A casino game style Discord bot. As with "CAD", this bot has sat idle with no updates for a while.
7. ["Chrome-Uno"](https://chrome-uno.herokuapp.com/pages/home.html) - An old, free to play, Uno game. At first, it was Chrome only because of CSS issues, but now Chrome also has its _own_ CSS issues, so here it sits, unfinished.
8. [Node system](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/javablocks) - An online node based programming system, as of yet unnamed.
